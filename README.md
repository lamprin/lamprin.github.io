Making us solve simple yet complex problems.

## About

lamprin is an artificial intelligence company. We aim at solving simple yet complex problems using machine intelligence. We are taking the most simplest problem from our everyday life which we do routinely without realising that we can ask a machine to bother about it while we focus on something more important.

To know more about the solutions we provide, please visit: [https://lampr.in](https://lampr.in).

### Basic Usage

After you clone the project, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp dev` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp sass` compiles SCSS files into CSS
- `gulp minify-css` minifies the compiled CSS file
- `gulp minify-js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp copy` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory
